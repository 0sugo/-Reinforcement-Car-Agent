Model Name: Reinforcement Learning Car Agent
aaaaaaaaaa
Algorithm: Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)

Environment: AWS DeepRacer Track

Reward Function:

Objective: Encourage the car to follow the centerline.
Structure:
Markers:
Marker 1: Closest to center (high reward)
Marker 2: Moderate distance (medium reward)
Marker 3: Far distance (low reward)
Speed Bonus: Additional reward for speeds above 2.0 m/s.
Penalty: Significant penalty for going off track or too far from the centerline.
Training Duration:

Initial training for 1-2 hours; monitor performance and adjust as needed based on lap times and reward metrics.
Observations:

Monitor lap times, off-track incidents, and average rewards during training.
Adjust reward values and thresholds based on model performance; experiment with speed thresholds to optimize lap times.
Next Steps:

Consider cloning the model after initial training for further improvements.
Submit to the leaderboard for performance evaluation against peers.
